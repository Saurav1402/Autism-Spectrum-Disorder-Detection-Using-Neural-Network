# Advanced Neural Network Architectures for ASD Diagnosis

## Description
This repository showcases the findings of a survey on neural network applications for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The paper explores the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in analyzing behavioral and facial data for ASD diagnosis, as well as addressing challenges like data diversity, generalization, and model interpretability.

## Features
- Behavioral Data Analysis: Leveraging neural networks to analyze behavioral assessments.
- Facial Image Data Analysis: Utilizing CNNs and transfer learning for facial feature extraction.
- Multi-modal Integration: Combining behavioral and facial data for improved diagnostic accuracy.
- Ethical Considerations: Highlights data privacy, consent, and diversity issues.

## Survey Findings
- Neural Network Success: CNNs for facial data and RNNs for behavioral patterns are effective.
- Challenges: Overfitting, limited datasets, and ethical concerns.
- Future Directions:
  - Creation of self-updating datasets for model relevancy.
  - Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model interpretability.
  - Multi-modal neural networks for integrating diverse data types.
